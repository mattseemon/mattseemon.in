 Here's what is happening currently in my life.
                
 * Moved to Goa from Bangalore in March, 2019. I was done with being sick most of the year <sup>(allergies)</sup> and dealing with the crazy traffic.
 * Mostly spending my time setting up my new place.
 * Waiting to get my kids, Pixie and Dust to join me here. Missing them terribly.
 * Enjoying the Monsoons properly for the first time in years.
 * And finally, drinking a lot of beer on the beach.
