## Who am I?

Now, that is a question I ask myself a lot. It's quite easy to explain that from the perspective of what I do for a living. But that barely scratches the surface.

Personally speaking I think, I am a confused soul, a dreamer, who prefers to believe that people are nice for the most part.

The only thing I know for sure, is I want to be a Happy Soul and exist in peace.

I am social when I need to be and an introvert rest of the times. The ocean calms me, so that explains the move to Goa. I hate social norms, yet conform to them. I avoid conflicts like the plague. I curse a lot. :grinning:

The idea behind this site is to showcase some of the stuff I do and also on occasion let you know what's going on in my life. To know what I am up to right now click [here](/now)
