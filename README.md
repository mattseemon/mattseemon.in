<a name = "about"></a>

This is the source code for version 2.0 of my personal website, portfolio and blog [mattseemon.in](https://mattseemon.in). For this version, I moved away from [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) purely out the interest of learning something new.

The user experience is inspired from the [Minimal](https://github.com/calintat/minimal) theme by [Calin Tataru](https://github.com/calintat/) and have used [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) framework to make the website responsive.

Serverless Deployments are done using [Now](https://zeit.co/now).

> Codebase for version 1.0 of this site can be found [here](https://github.com/mattseemon/mattseemon.in/tree/master).
